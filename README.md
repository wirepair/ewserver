# Embedded Web Server
This is a template for a web server allowing me to hook up my various embedded projects to an HTTPS server. 

# UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Do Not Use.

## Features
- Full sessions, authentication and authorization, users, and role management.
- A management UI
- API Key based users for allowing embedded systems to publish or consume data to / from the web.
- Based on the boltdb KV store, but developed in a way to allow easy substitution of services due to the elegant interface services design outlined by [@benbjohnson](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson).
